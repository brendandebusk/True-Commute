# About

TrueCommute calculates a more accurate estimate for your commute time by tying together traffic data (historical and current when applicable) with weather forecasts along your route. 

Built with React and responsive across device form-factors. Routing data provided by Mapbox, weather data provided by the National Weather Service.
